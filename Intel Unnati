🎯 **LLM_Finetuning_CPU_Chatbot**

This repository documents the complete workflow and environment setup for fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) on a CPU-based system, as part of the **Intel® Unnati Industrial Training on AI/ML**. The outcome was a **custom chatbot** built using the `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` model, showcasing real-world LLM deployment under constrained hardware environments.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

- **Fine-tuning** of LLaMA-2 model on local CPU using Hugging Face datasets.
- **Environment configuration** via Anaconda and `ipykernel` for local Jupyter execution.
- **Offline model access** using Git LFS for large-scale model cloning.
- **Custom chatbot deployment** with validation using Alpaca, CNN/DailyMail, and Evol-Codealpaca datasets.
- **Error resolution** for Hugging Face CLI and token authentication in restricted environments.
